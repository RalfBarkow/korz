# AGENTS

## rgb (project owner)
- Frames the Korz projection-object vision and curates problem statements.
- Provides architectural intent through `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and future review/acceptance.
- Decides when to expand scope (e.g., GT integration depth, ensembles).

## Codex (GPT-5 coding agent)
- Translates requirements into Pharo/GToolkit code, tests, and docs within the repo.
- Maintains alignment with the implementation plan, keeping supporting docs (SPEC/RESEARCH/WORKLOG) current.
- Surfaces risks, open questions, or approval needs to rgb before making blocking assumptions.

## Future collaborators
- May extend Korz beyond the minimal kernel (ensembles, interpreter-behaviour dimensions, pattern selectors).
- Should update this roster when additional agents or reviewers participate.
