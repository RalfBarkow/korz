				"string" : "We are given a detailed critique of the Korz programming model and its slot space. The critique points out several potential weaknesses and suggests experiments to falsify the claims of the model. We are to continue the report and falsification attempts, focusing on the provided points. [deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/f99b1e9b-8cd6-4687-b3d1-fe7e7a5a10c2)\n\nThe critique already covers many aspects, so we can extend it by considering additional angles and perhaps synthesizing the falsification attempts into a cohesive testing plan.\n\nLet's break down the critique and see what we can add:\nSymmetry Compromised by rcvr: The special treatment of rcvr breaks the symmetry. We can design experiments that measure the frequency of rcvr usage and its necessity for ergonomics.\nIDE Reliance: The model's scalability and comprehensibility depend on an advanced IDE. We can design a study that removes IDE support and measures productivity.\nMultiple Dispatch and Combination: The lack of method combination (like call-next-method) and the requirement for a unique slot may break in scenarios that require multiple behaviors. We can test AOP-style scenarios.\nGlobal Dimension Names: The global namespace for dimensions may cause collisions when merging. We can simulate merging two projects and measure the effort to resolve conflicts.\nSimplicity Claim: The model may shift complexity to the dispatch and IDE. We can compare with existing models (like Hyper/J) on a remodularization task.\nSubjectivity and Identity: The subjective object views may break invariants. We can test invariants under different views.\nDispatch Performance: The dispatch algorithm may have poor worst-case performance. We can stress-test the dispatch with many dimensions and slots.\nBlocks and Context Capture: The under-specified semantics of blocks and context may lead to surprises. We can test non-local returns and context leakage.\nSelector Not a Dimension: The selector is not treated as a dimension, which may limit meta-programming. We can test meta-programming scenarios.\nDebugging and Observability: The implicit context and subjective views may make debugging hard. We can measure the time to root cause for misdispatch bugs.\nEvolvability: The model's evolvability claims are not backed by longitudinal data. We can simulate evolution tasks and measure breakage and cognitive load.\nWe are also given concrete experiments to run. We can structure our continued report by outlining these experiments and predicting the outcomes that would falsify Korz's claims.\n\nLet's outline a plan for continued falsification:\n\nExperiment 1: Ambiguous Matches\nGoal: Test the claim that there is always a unique best match.\nMethod: Create two slots with guards that are both matching and are not ordered by specificity (e.g., two unrelated dimensions). Check if the dispatch fails or picks one arbitrarily.\nFalsification: If the dispatch does not fail and picks one arbitrarily, then the programmer cannot rely on the behavior without knowing the arbitrary rule. If it fails, then the program is broken by ambiguous matches.\nExperiment 2: Method Combination\nGoal: Test the expressiveness of the model for AOP-style advice.\nMethod: Try to implement before, after, and around advice for a method without duplicating code.\nFalsification: If the only way to achieve this is by duplicating code or introducing extra dimensions and slots in a way that becomes unmanageable, then the model fails to support composition that is easily achieved in AOP.\nExperiment 3: Namespace Collision\nGoal: Test the modularity claim when merging two slot spaces.\nMethod: Take two independently developed slot spaces that use the same dimension name for different purposes and merge them. Measure the effort to resolve conflicts and the number of unintended dispatch changes.\nFalsification: If the merge requires significant manual effort and causes broken behavior due to unintended dispatch, then the global dimension namespace is a problem.\nExperiment 4: Subjectivity and Invariants\nGoal: Test whether invariants can be broken by changing the subjective view.\nMethod: Encode a model with an invariant that holds in one view (e.g., pov=adjacent) and then change the view (e.g., pov=symmetric) and check the invariant.\nFalsification: If the invariant breaks, then the model introduces a new kind of Heisenbug that depends on the subjective view, which is unacceptable.\nExperiment 5: Dispatch Scaling\nGoal: Test the performance of the dispatch algorithm.\nMethod: Generate a large number of slots with overlapping guards and measure the dispatch time as the number of slots and dimensions grows.\nFalsification: If the dispatch time grows polynomially or exponentially with the number of slots or dimensions, then the model does not scale.\nExperiment 6: Block and Context Semantics\nGoal: Test the behavior of blocks and non-local returns in the presence of dynamic context.\nMethod: Create a block that performs a non-local return and see if it behaves correctly when the context changes.\nFalsification: If the non-local return leads to unexpected behavior or context leakage, then the model has a serious flaw in its handling of control flow and context.\nExperiment 7: Selector as a Dimension\nGoal: Test the flexibility of the model when the selector is needed as a dimension.\nMethod: Try to implement a meta-protocol that dispatches on the selector (e.g., for auditing) and see if it can be done without resorting to tooling or workarounds.\nFalsification: If the model does not allow treating the selector as a dimension and requires special tooling, then the model is not as uniform as claimed.\nExperiment 8: Debuggability\nGoal: Test the claim that the IDE can help with debugging.\nMethod: Without the IDE, give developers misdispatch bugs and measure the time to root cause. Then compare with the IDE. Also, compare with traditional OO languages.\nFalsification: If the time to root cause is significantly higher without the IDE, then the model is too complex for practical debugging. If even with the IDE it is worse than traditional languages, then the model's debuggability claims are false.\nExperiment 9: Evolvability\nGoal: Test the claim that the model supports evolution.\nMethod: Simulate a series of evolution tasks (like adding a feature, changing a cross-cutting concern) and measure the code churn, breakage, and cognitive load compared to other models.\nFalsification: If the evolution tasks require more changes and cause more breakage, or if the cognitive load is higher, then the evolvability claim is false.\nWe can also consider the following:\n\nExperiment 10: Special Treatment of rcvr\nGoal: Measure the frequency and necessity of rcvr in real code.\nMethod: Analyze a corpus of Korz code (if available) or port a medium-sized OO program to Korz and count the use of rcvr and other dimensions.\nFalsification: If rcvr is used in a majority of slots and is necessary for the common case, then the symmetry is broken in practice.\nExperiment 11: IDE Reliance\nGoal: Test the claim that the IDE is critical.\nMethod: Give developers a medium-sized Korz codebase and a set of maintenance tasks without the advanced IDE features (only a text editor). Then measure the time and correctness of the tasks.\nFalsification: If developers cannot perform the tasks in a reasonable time without the IDE, then the model is not robust and depends on tooling.\nWe can now structure the continued report as follows:\n\nContinued Report: Falsification Attempts for Korz\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe are extending the previous incisive review by designing and executing a set of experiments aimed at falsifying the core claims of the Korz programming model. The claims we are testing include:\n\nSimplicity and symmetry of the model.\nScalability with IDE support.\nExpressiveness of the multiple dispatch and context-oriented programming.\nModularity through dimensions.\nEvolvability and debuggability.\nExperimental Setup\n\nWe will use a prototype implementation of Korz (if available) or simulate the behavior based on the specification. For some experiments, we may need to implement a minimal version of Korz to run the tests.\n\nExperiments and Results\n\nExperiment 1: Ambiguous Matches\nSetup: Create two slots with guards that are both matching and are not ordered by specificity. For example, two slots with guards {d1 ≤ A, d2 ≤ B} and {d1 ≤ B, d2 ≤ A} in a context {d1: A, d2: A}. Note: We assume that the coordinates form a lattice (with a partial order). We need to set up the coordinates so that the two guards are not comparable.\nExpected Falsification: The dispatch either fails or picks one arbitrarily. This would break the promise of deterministic behavior and require the programmer to know the arbitrary rule.\nExperiment 2: Method Combination\nSetup: Attempt to implement before, after, and around advice for a method drawPixel without code duplication. We try to use dimensions location and isColorblind to attach the advice.\nExpected Falsification: Korz does not have a built-in mechanism for ordering the execution of multiple matching slots. Therefore, we cannot achieve method combination without refactoring the code into a single slot that explicitly calls the next method or using another dimension to control order. This would show a lack of composition mechanism.\nExperiment 3: Namespace Collision\nSetup: Merge two slot spaces that both define a dimension pov but with different coordinates and different meanings. Then, try to run a message send that uses pov in a context that exists in both original spaces.\nExpected Falsification: The merge causes unintended dispatch because the two pov dimensions are the same. Resolving this requires renaming one of the dimensions and updating all slots and message sends that use it, which is error-prone and breaks modularity.\nExperiment 4: Subjectivity and Invariants\nSetup: Create a slot space with two dimensions pov and data. Define an invariant that holds when pov=adjacent but breaks when pov=symmetric because the same data is grouped differently.\nExpected Falsification: The invariant breaks when the viewpoint changes, showing that the model introduces a new kind of Heisenbug that depends on the subjective view.\nExperiment 5: Dispatch Scaling\nSetup: Generate a slot space with N dimensions and M coordinates per dimension, and create slots with random guards. Then, measure the time to dispatch a message in a random context as N and M grow.\nExpected Falsification: The dispatch time grows exponentially or polynomially with the number of dimensions or slots, making it unsuitable for large-scale applications.\nExperiment 6: Block and Context Semantics\nSetup: Create a block that captures the current context and then escapes to a different context. Then, call the block in a context that has modified the dimension bindings. Also, try a non-local return from inside a block that is called in a different context.\nExpected Falsification: The block either uses the context of its creation or the context of its invocation in a way that leads to unexpected behavior. This would show that the context semantics are tricky and error-prone.\nExperiment 7: Selector as a Dimension\nSetup: Try to implement a meta-protocol that dispatches on the selector. For example, we want to count the number of invocations of each selector. We try to define a slot that matches on the selector dimension.\nExpected Falsification: The model does not allow the selector to be a dimension, so we cannot define such a slot without changing the model or using tooling. This breaks the uniformity.\nExperiment 8: Debuggability\nSetup: Without the IDE, give developers a misdispatch bug and measure the time to root cause. Then, compare with the IDE and with traditional OO languages.\nExpected Falsification: Without the IDE, developers take significantly longer to find the root cause. Even with the IDE, the time is longer than in traditional OO languages because of the implicit context and multiple dimensions.\nExperiment 9: Evolvability\nSetup: Simulate a series of evolution tasks on a medium-sized Korz codebase and measure the code churn and breakage. Compare with a similar codebase in a traditional OO language or another COP language.\nExpected Falsification: The evolution tasks in Korz require more changes and cause more breakage because of the global dimension namespace and the implicit context.\nExperiment 10: Special Treatment of rcvr\nSetup: Port a medium-sized OO program to Korz and count the use of rcvr and other dimensions.\nExpected Falsification: The rcvr dimension is used in a majority of slots, showing that the symmetry is broken in practice.\nExperiment 11: IDE Reliance\nSetup: Give developers a medium-sized Korz codebase and a set of maintenance tasks without the advanced IDE features. Measure the time and correctness.\nExpected Falsification: Developers cannot complete the tasks in a reasonable time without the IDE, showing that the model is not robust without tooling.\nConclusion\n\nIf the experiments yield the expected results, then the claims of Korz are falsified in several key aspects. The model may be too complex, not scalable, and lacking in composition mechanisms and modularity. The reliance on an advanced IDE is a critical risk. The symmetry is broken by the special treatment of rcvr. The global dimension namespace is a modularity problem. The dispatch performance and semantics of blocks and context are potential showstoppers.\n\nNext Steps\n\nWe recommend that the Korz model be extended to address these issues, or that the claims be revised. In particular, the model should:\n\nIntroduce a mechanism for method combination.\nProvide a namespace mechanism for dimensions.\nSpecify the semantics of blocks and context more clearly.\nProvide a scalable dispatch algorithm.\nReduce the reliance on the IDE by simplifying the model.\nOtherwise, the model may not be suitable for practical software development.\n\nThis report continues the incisive review by outlining concrete experiments to test the claims of Korz. The experiments are designed to falsify the claims by exposing weaknesses in the model. The results of these experiments would provide evidence for or against the viability of Korz in practice."
